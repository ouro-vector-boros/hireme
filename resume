### Projects & Technical Experience

**Project: Accelerated Domain Mastery (Case Study: Lyrical Engineering)**
*   Applied engineering first principles and conceptual analysis to deconstruct and master the domain of complex lyrical composition, achieving expert-level output within a one-week timeframe.
*   **Outcome:** This project serves as a powerful demonstration of an elite, transferable skill: the ability to rapidly learn, internalize, and innovate within any new technical system, language, or complex problem space, drastically reducing ramp-up time.

**Project: Conceptual Framework for a Dinosaur Emotion Simulator**
*   Architected a novel framework for a real-time emotion simulator, designed to model multi-dimensional emotional states and cognitive load ("Pressure") for a neurodivergent target audience.
*   Designed a 2D rigging system proof-of-concept using center-of-mass calculations for automated, dynamic asset positioning, showcasing a practical approach to solving complex graphics challenges.
*   **Technologies:** C++ (conceptual), Python (for tooling), 2D Animation Principles.

**Project: Generative Art & Visual Concepts ("Malady Paladin")**
*   Authored a highly detailed, multi-layered prompt for a generative AI model to produce "Malady Paladin," a visual representation of complex psychological and systemic themes.
*   The resulting artwork demonstrates a sophisticated ability to guide AI as a creative partner, translating abstract, stream-of-consciousness concepts into a coherent and compelling visual narrative.
*   **Technologies:** AI Prompt Engineering, Generative Models (e.g., Midjourney), Digital Art Direction.
