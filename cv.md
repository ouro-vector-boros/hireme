### Project Portfolio & Research

#### Project: Accelerated Domain Mastery (Case Study: Lyrical Engineering)
*   **Description:** A self-directed, high-intensity research project into the structure of lyrical expression. Applied engineering principles (e.g., systems analysis, pattern recognition, optimization) to deconstruct and master the art of complex, multi-syllabic rhyme schemes and narrative flow.
*   **Methodology:** Utilized a conceptual, non-textual cognitive style (aphantasia-driven) to build abstract models of rhythm, rhyme, and meaning, which were then translated into concrete lyrical output.
*   **Outcome:** Achieved expert-level proficiency in a new creative domain in under a week. This project serves as a powerful demonstration of an elite, transferable skill: the ability to rapidly learn, internalize, and innovate within any new technical system.

#### Project: Conceptual Framework for a Dinosaur Emotion Simulator
*   **Description:** Architected a complete conceptual framework for a real-time interactive simulator. The design prioritizes emotional literacy for a neurodivergent audience by modeling emotions as multi-dimensional and representing cognitive load as a core "Pressure" metric.
*   **Technical Design:**
    *   *Emotion System:* A flexible, data-driven system allowing for customizable emotion pairs (e.g., Happy/Angry, Stim/Noise).
    *   *Rigging System:* A proposed 2D rigging system based on center-of-mass calculations from image transparency data.
*   **Relevance:** Demonstrates ability to architect entire systems from the ground up, with a focus on user experience, technical innovation, and practical implementation planning.

#### Creative Work: "Malady Paladin" - A Study in Generative Narrative
*   **Description:** A multi-modal creative project combining a 1,000+ word freestyle poem with a piece of generative AI art.
*   **Process:** The freestyle text, exploring themes of systemic failure and resilience, was used as the conceptual seed for a highly detailed AI image prompt, involving iterative refinement to translate dense lyrical content into a coherent visual narrative.
*   **Significance:** Represents a sophisticated workflow for human-AI creative collaboration, using deep narrative as a driver for complex visual generation.
